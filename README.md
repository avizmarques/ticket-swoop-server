# Ticket-swoop
This project was created as part of my final assignment of the [Codaisseur Full-Stack Bootcamp](https://codaisseur.com/courses/academy/). It allows users to register, login, create events and add tickets to those events. It also calculates and displays risk factors for each ticket.

## Some of the technologies used:
* React
* Redux
* Express (REST API)
* Sequelize
* jsonwebtoken
* bcrypt
* postgres
